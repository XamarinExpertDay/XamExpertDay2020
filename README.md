### TinyMvvm for Xamarin.Forms

**Daniel Hindrikes** - [@Hindrikes](https://twitter.com/hindrikes)

TinyMvvm is an open-source library created by Daniel Hindrikes when he realized that he spends a lot of time writing the same code over and over again when he started new apps but also in the same app when adding new views and ViewModels.

Some of the futures in TinyMvvm:
* NavigationHelper that supports both Shell and the classic NavigationService.
* Passing objects as parameters, both when using Shell and classic navigation.
* ViewModel navigation with Shell.
* Add BindingContext in View, but still be able to use DI in ViewModels.
* Lifecycle events in ViewModels.
* INotiftyPropertyChanged implementation.

In this session, Daniel will show you how to use TinyMvvm but also how it is built to get a deeper understanding of how it works under the hood.

### Supercharge You Custom Controls With Control Templates

**Hussain Abbasi** - [@HussainNAbbasi](https://twitter.com/HussainNAbbasi)

What are Control Templates?
Control Templates are a great way to customize your app’s view with themes and custom layouts. Xamarin.Forms has Control Templates that allow for separation of the presentation layer from the control. This enables the configuration of the UI at runtime.

Can I bind my data to them?
Control templates support template binding that allows data binding to the UI. This enables the control to present data bound to a binding context, and present different UIs for same data model.

How do they work?
In this session, we will go over the concept and examples of creating and consuming Control Templates. We will live code a responsive UI that is configured at runtime. You don’t want to miss it.
